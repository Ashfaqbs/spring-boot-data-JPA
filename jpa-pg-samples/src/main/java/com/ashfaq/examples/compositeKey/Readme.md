## Understanding @IdClass in JPA

- When an entity has a composite key (multiple columns as a primary key), we can use @IdClass.
- The class referenced in @IdClass should have fields matching the primary key columns in the entity.
- The existsById() method in Spring Data JPA is used to check if a record exists based on its primary key.


- Call the endpoint:

http://localhost:8080/entity/exists?id1=1&id2=A123

```
Output:

true
```



### **How `existsById()` Works in Spring Data JPA**
`existsById(ID id)` is a method in `CrudRepository<T, ID>` that checks whether an entity with the given ID exists in the database.  

Since you're using a **composite key** (`@IdClass` with `MyEntityId`), `existsById()` internally does the following:  
1. **Convert `MyEntityId` to a WHERE condition**:  
   - `MyEntityId` is an object containing `id1` and `id2`.  
   - JPA translates this into a WHERE clause: `WHERE id1 = ? AND id2 = ?`.  
   
2. **Generate the SQL query**:  
   - The repository method `existsById()` is converted into a `SELECT` query using **COUNT** (because `existsById()` just checks for existence, not fetching the record).

### **How `existsById()` Converts to a Native Query**
Under the hood, `existsById()` is translated into an SQL query similar to:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM tempschema.my_entity 
WHERE id1 = ? AND id2 = ?;
```
- `COUNT(*)` is used to check if any rows exist.  
- If the count is **greater than 0**, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.  
- The placeholders `?` will be replaced with actual values (`id1=1`, `id2='A123'` in our case).

---

### **Matching SQL Query for Your Use Case**
If you were to write a native SQL query to match the behavior of `existsById()`, it would be:

```sql
SELECT CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN TRUE 
    ELSE FALSE 
END AS exists_flag
FROM tempschema.my_entity
WHERE id1 = 1 AND id2 = 'A123';
```
- This query checks if any record exists in `my_entity` with `id1=1` and `id2='A123'`.
- If at least one row exists, it returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.

This is exactly how Spring Data JPA handles it under the hood when you call:

```java
repository.existsById(new MyEntityId(1L, "A123"));
```
